EBAY SCRAPER LIBARY FOR GOOGLE SHEETS

This apps script library is a coding template for extracting various data from ebay websites though had only been used for ebay.com. Rather than building a library from scratch you can open this one and add the script id to any Google Sheet where you wish to use the included functions.

Note: This version of the library might not extract titles, prices, and other data succesfully. This can be corrected by examining the HTML on eBay websites and modifying the regular expressions accordingly.

Here is the link to open the apps script code. Make your own copy for use.
